# Ideas for New Features

Here are a few ideas I had for fun things you could do with the app while I was using it...

### CIDR Bar Minigame
You are a bartender at the Escape student bar, and there are 32 tables laid out in front of you in a row. Some of the tables have thirsty customers sitting at them, and some of the tables are blank. Your job is to serve them glasses full of Apple CIDR such that only the tables with customers get a drink. You can do this by typing in the IP address in CIDR format. 

Alternatively, you could also click the individual tables on and off, which would update to show you the CIDR address for the current setup, so that students could get an intrensic feel for it.

### Circuit Blaster Minigame
You are flying your spaceship through the galaxy, and come upon the Evil Empire's warships. One by one in a line, they try to fly into you can blow you up, and you have one shot per ship to get them first. These ships have a hologram machine, so that they make holographic copies that also fly towards you. (Think three ships, where only one is real, in a random order.)

For some crazy reason, the emporer has put a ciruit (either as a diagram or as a string) on the side of each ship that results in a 1. The holograms, however, have ciruit strings that result in a 0. Your job is the fire on the single correct ship before it crashes into you.
